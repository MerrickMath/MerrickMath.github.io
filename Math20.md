### Current Homework:
**Nov. 6-15:** For the November break please **compelete** the assignments from lessons 2-3 (pg.203-206 and pg.313-316) and **review** the assignments from lessons 4-5 (pg.319-323, and pg. 328-331). I am **not** expecting you to have lessons 4-5+ mastered upon our return from the break, I would just like you to read through the assignment and complete as much as you know at this momment. I think you will all find that there is significant overlap from prior units/years. Have a **FANTASTIC** break!
